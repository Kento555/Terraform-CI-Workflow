You're getting this error because terraform fmt -check found formatting issues in your Terraform files (specifically, main.tf).
The exit code 3 is expected behavior when -check detects files that are not properly formatted.
   
âœ… What it means   
Your Terraform file(s) have formatting issues. The CI pipeline is intentionally failing because youâ€™ve enabled terraform fmt -check, which checks if files are formatted and fails if theyâ€™re not.
   
ðŸ”¥ How to fix it   
On your local machine, run:
   

terraform fmt     
This will auto-format your .tf files correctly. Then, commit and push the changes:
   
   
git add .   
git commit -m "Fix: Terraform format issues"   
git push origin <your-branch>
